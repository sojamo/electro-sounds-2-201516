# Electro Sounds, Session 3

In this session we are looking at various techniques to generate and use numbers as inputs for a computer program. This includes randomly generated numbers, numbers derived from noise algorithms, the fast fourier transform algorithm which translates a (sound) signal into its frequency spectrum, amongst other algorithms.

To get a good overview of randomness and noise, please read Daniel Shiffman's [introduction chapter](http://natureofcode.com/book/introduction/) of his [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/book/) book. All code examples of the book can be found on github at [The Nature of Code Examples](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples). For this session have a closer look at the Random Walk and Noise examples to be found inside the [introduction](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples/tree/master/introduction) section.

Another excellent resource is the [Generative Design](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de) book with a large variety of visual applications and example codes which are available as [.zip](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/code) file from the website's code section.
