## Semester 2


This semester will be about generating images using code and algorithms. You will make use of and create your own generative systems with the means of a range of coding techniques and good ideas. To get started, a quote by Philip Galanter from his paper _What is Generative Art?_ 	

> Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist uses a
system, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer
program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is set
into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or
resulting in a completed work of art.

_P. Galanter, "What is Generative Art? Complexity theory as a
context for art theory," in International Conference on Generative
Art, Milan, Italy, 2003._



## Sessions
There will be 5 sessions this semester. Each week we will meet for 3 hours, optional and upon appointment you can book individual tutorials (up to 30 minutes) with me.

### Session 1: Getting Started

**Week 1-4**. Getting to know the Processing Environment. During this session you will learn a range of programming principles that will help you to create generative visual through coding.

  - What is an API?
  - Where to find documentation?
  - How to save and organize your documents?

To successfully complete all required assignments, the following concepts must be understood and practiced. You will find an example for each item inside the sessions folder.

  - Blocks, Functions, Scope
  - Variables and Data Structures
  - Loops
  - Conditionals
  - Objects
  - Various drawing techniques
  	- Shape primitives
  	- Lines and Curves
  	- Custom shapes
  	- Transformations
  	- Pixel manipulation
  - Shaders
	  - what is a shader?
	  - a simple shader example, a filter.
  - Libraries
	  - how to extend Processing with Libraries
		  - controlP5
		  - midimapper
		  - VideoExport


*Assignment A* due in week 4.

### Session 2: From Sketch to Video
**Week 5-6** In this session you will familiarize yourself with different recording methods to capture the visual output of your Processing sketches.

  - saveFrame
  - Syphon
  - ffmpeg

### Session 3: Algorithms and Aesthetics

**Week 6-9**. This session will explore the beauty of algorithms/

  - Linear, Random and Noise  
  	- random walk
  	- perlin and simplex noise
  - Data Driven
  - Particles and Complexity
  - Glitch

Furthermore we will look into the characteristics and strategies of computation and generative aesthetics that have been widely used within the context of generative art.

*Assignment B* due in week 9.

### Session 4: From Input to Output
**Week 10-11**. In this session we will look at different forms of input and how they lead to output through processing incoming data.

*Assignment C* due week 11

### Session 5: Open Session
**Week 10-11**.
  - work on your *Assignment D* project, class attendance is required.
  - individual tutorials upon appointment

**Assignment D** due Monday of week 16

## Assignment
This semester you will learn about generative systems and processes, the following 4 assignments will help you exercise and practice various coding techniques covered in class.

  1. **Assignment A** Create a series of 3 sketches that resemble one work of each of the following artists: Frieder Nake, Sol Lewitt, Ryoji Ikeda. *(naming convention, sketch size is 960x540, include image in data folder)*
  2. **Assignment B** Use a selection of your current Processing sketches that use code to animate abstract, geometric visuals. add your own sound track that supports the visuals and create a 15 seconds long generative video. *(sketch size is 960x540, sketch archiving, quicktime format and quality, 1x vimeo format, 1x instagram format)*
  3. **Assignment C** Choose one Processing project from the Processing Exhibition that relates to the concept of Generative Art (see References to get to know more about Generative Art) and describe in 150 words why you like the project. Then describe in your own words (150) how the project works technically. Create a Processing sketch that visually-animated illustrates one aspect of the project you have chosen. *(use markdown format and export your document as pdf, properly structure your text, include 2 project images and 1 sketch still, include references)*
  4. **Assignment D** Create a 90-120 seconds music video using your own sound track and a range of coding techniques you have learned so far. Combine at least one of each of the following categories: **A** algorithmic, generative, interactive, geometric **B** camera reactive, audio reactive, shaders, **C** midi, live performance, projection mapping, animated-gifs **D** mellow, calm, suspense, frantic *(sketch format is 1920x1080, sketch and process archived on github, process documentation, project description (elaborate on the techniques used, give examples), title)*

All assignments accumulate to one final project. All assignments must be documented on your blog.

## Resources

### Frameworks

In this class we will focus on [Processing](http://www.processing.org) as our learning tool. Processing comes in various flavors, the most prominent and the original version is written in Java hence the java like syntax, and you can make use of existing Java libraries and code. [P5js](http://www.p5js.org) is the Javascript sister project that allows you to create Processing sketches that can run inside a browser. This project is relatively young and currently supports 2D visuals and only to a certain extend 3D graphics. The syntax is slightly different from the Java version but similar in vocabulary.

Other frameworks for creative coding include
  - [Open Frameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/)
  - [vvvv](https://vvvv.org/)
  - [cinder](https://libcinder.org/)

### Misc

  - To keep your code organized and in one place, consider to use github to host your code repositories.
  - Some exercises require you to write short texts, do consider to write these text in markdown, a very simple formatting syntax for writing text inside simple text editors.
